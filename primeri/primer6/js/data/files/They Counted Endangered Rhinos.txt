They Counted Endangered Rhinos in Nepal And the Population Has Grown By 16%

A third country has announced some good news for rhinos this year. Populations of the endangered 
one-horned rhinoceros in Nepal have increased by 16% over the past six years.

The new National Rhino Count 2021 estimates the current number stands at 752 individuals up 
from 645 in 2015. Rhinos were counted across the country between March 22 and April 10, including 
within four national parks, including Chitwan.

In the 1960s there were only around 100 left in the country.

The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation used 57 elephants in their search 
for rhinos, along with 350 trained personnel who swept the jungle areas to document a species headcount.

During the process, they also collected data on habitat conditions, invasive species in the area, 
and human activities in the region.

"The overall growth in population size is indicative of ongoing protection and habitat management 
efforts by protected area authorities, despite challenging contexts these past years," said Ghana 
Gurung, Country Representative of WWF Nepal.

"This achievement is yet another milestone in Nepal's conservation journey."
