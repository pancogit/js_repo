Biodegradable Food Wrap Created From Algae and Cinnamon Compound is the Packaging Solution We Needed

Scientists from India and Russia have created edible food wrap for packaging produce, bakery, 
poultry, meat, and seafood.

Designed to replace one of the most un-recycled materials on the planet, the wrap consists of 
natural ingredients that are safe for the environment and humans.

The research, which was published in the Journal of Food Engineering, describes three types of 
food films based on the well-known naturally occurring seaweed biopolymer sodium alginate—a 
compound found within the cell walls of brown algae.

“Its molecules have film-forming properties,” said Rammohan Aluru, senior researcher at 
the organic synthesis laboratory at Ural Federal University, and co-author of the paper. 
“The greatest advantage of sodium alginate is that it performs as liquid-gel in an aqueous medium.”

Alginate molecules were cross-linked with a natural antioxidant ferulic acid (a derivative 
of cinnamic acid), and the delicious combination makes the film not only strong, but also 
homogeneous, more rigid, prolonging the life of the products, say the scientists.
