9 Eco Deals For Earth Day – Ways to Treat Yourself and The Planet

First celebrated 51 years ago on April 22nd, Earth Day was a holiday born of 
civic-mindedness, meant to celebrate nature in all her glorious forms, and to 
take one rotation of the Earth to give something back to her.

Sustainability was not so much a buzz word then as it is now, and we were unlikely 
to see Earth Day sales on recycled rugs or buy-one-plant-one offers back in the ’70s.

Today though, Earth Day has a whole new connotation, since caring for our rock 
is becoming more important than ever before.

This year, GNN has gone out and found some great deals for responsible splurging—ways 
to treat yourself, your wallet, and the planet.
