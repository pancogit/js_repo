Daimler Trucks is Now Accepting Orders for All-Electric Freight Trucks, Having Tested Them on America's Highways

Stepping into the future of carbon-neutral freight transportation, Daimler Trucks North America is 
now accepting orders for its first all-electric freight trucks, which they call the longest-range 
commercial battery EVs for interstate shipping in North America today.

Daimler's Freightliner manufacturing division has put the eM2 box truck and eCascadia freight tractor 
into the hands of customers, who have been running real freight in the real world for over two years.

Having demonstrated the concept, they will begin production of the trucks in 2022 and provide a 
"dedicated network of Freightliner dealers to support the end-to-end process of fleet electrification."

Currently with 38 trucks in a pilot fleet covering hundreds of thousands of miles in testing, 
senior vice president Richard Howard said, "The entire team at Daimler Trucks North America is 
incredibly proud of our progress."
