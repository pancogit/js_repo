Archaeologists Discover ‘Dazzling’ 3,000-Year-old Egyptian City, Left ‘As if it were yesterday’

It’s the stuff of dreams and is being hailed as the second-most important discovery since the opening 
of Tutankhamen’s tomb—an ancient lost city has been found near the famous Valley of the Kings.

Excavations began 6 months ago in September about 300 miles south of Cairo, and before long 
“to the team’s great surprise, formations of mud bricks began to appear in all directions.”

These are the words of famed Egyptologist and former antiquities minister Dr. Zahi Hawass, 
who posted a statement of the discovery on Facebook.

Identified as “Dazzling Aten,” it’s the largest-ever lost city to be uncovered in Egypt, and 
dated to the reign of one of the most powerful pharaohs to rule during the kingdom’s golden age, Amenhotep III.

Ruling from 1391 to 1353 BCE alongside his son, the equally famous Akhenaten, Hawass described 
their city as being in “a good condition of preservation, with almost complete walls, and with 
rooms filled with tools of daily life.”

“Many foreign missions searched for this city and never found it,” he added. “We began our work 
searching for the mortuary temple of Tutankhamun because the temples of both Horemheb and Ay 
(two other significant pharaohs) were found in this area.”

Featuring zigzagging walls, a rarity in ancient Egypt, the haunts of specialty craftsmen, 
such as brickmakers, glazers, and jewelers, have been discovered, along with evidence of their 
work, such as the seal of Amenhotep III that would have been used to stamp into mud bricks that 
likely built several nearby monuments such as the Temple of Ramses II.
