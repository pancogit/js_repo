Walmart Commits to Helping Save Pollinators By Mandating Change For Supply Chains

Without pollinators like bees, butterflies, birds, and beetles, some of our favorite foods would 
not exist and Walmart has announced a set of plans in the U.S. to persuade its grocery supply chain 
to adopt principles that will protect them.

Walmart's new commitments announced this week, serve as the largest pollinator health effort from 
a U.S. grocery retailer to date, according to the head of produce sourcing for Walmart U.S., Martin Mundo. 
The aim is to reduce several pollinator threats through promoting integrated pest management (IPM) 
practices and improving and expanding pollinator habitats.

Walmart U.S. will source 100% of the fresh produce and floral items it sells in its in-store 
produce department from suppliers that adopt integrated pest management practices, as verified 
by a third party, by next five years.

America's largest retailer will also encourage fresh produce suppliers to report their pesticide 
application and biodiversity management annually, through Walmart's annual sustainability surveys.

"We are also encouraging fresh produce suppliers to phase out use of chlorpyrifos and nitroguanidine 
neonicotinoids pesticides (where applicable unless mandated otherwise by law) and avoid replacing 
them with products having a level I bee precaution rating and assess and report annual progress," 
wrote Mundo on the Walmart corporate website.
