Spectacular Super Pink Moon Set to Rise Next Week Here's How to Photograph It in the Night Sky

You'll want to set aside a little moon-gazing time this Monday evening as April 
26 is set to be the night of the Super Pink Moon.

The best time to see it is as it's appearing over the eastern horizon. 
At that point the Moon will appear a deep tangerine, then a steady gold, 
then pure white as it climbs ever higher in the sky. This is because of 
Rayleigh scattering the same phenomenon that causes sunsets to take on reddish tints.

Contrary to its name, this month's full Moon won't actually look pink. 
According to Farmer's Almanac, it actually gets its name from the North American 
wildflower Phlox Subulata, also known as creeping phlox or moss phlox, which blooms in spring.

Supermoons are typically about seven percent bigger and around 15 percent brighter than 
a regular full Moon. And this month's is special, being one of only two such supermoons 
for next year (the next is in May).

But is the Moon actually closer to us when it's on the horizon? 
Is that why it looks so huge? According to NASA, the answer is no. It's just an illusion.
