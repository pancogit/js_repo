It’s Time to Watch the Biggest Meteor Shower of the Spring, Known for its Fireballs

It’s been a few months since we had our last meteor shower, but the night sky is about to light 
up once again—with starry streaks brightening the night.

This annual Lyrid meteor shower will begin tonight on April 16, and it’ll peak next week from April 21-22.

The Lyrids are one of the oldest known meteor showers, having been observed 2,700 years ago 
in historical Chinese texts.

According to the American Meteor Society, the Lyrids “usually lack persistent trains but can 
produce fireballs”—with NASA confirming they can often be seen for many seconds at a time.

Best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere, to see the Lyrids head out to a dark area and look 
towards the Lyra constellation which rises in the east.

For help finding the constellation, you may want to check out this interactive sky map that’s 
being updating daily through the Lyrids.

If you have clear skies, lucky you: you can expect to see very bright meteors at a forecast 
rate of up to 18 per hour.
