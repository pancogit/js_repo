To Help Protect Your Heart When Stressed, Scientists Suggest Eating or Drinking These Things

Increased consumption of flavanols a group of molecules occurring naturally in many fruit and 
vegetables could protect people from mental stress-induced cardiovascular events such as stroke, 
heart disease, and thrombosis, according to new research.

In their study, researchers at the University of Birmingham discovered that blood vessels 
were able to function better during mental stress when people were given a cocoa drink 
containing high levels of flavanols than when drinking a non-flavanol enriched drink.

A thin membrane of cells lining the heart and blood vessels, when functioning efficiently 
the endothelium helps to reduce the risk of peripheral vascular disease, stroke, heart disease, 
diabetes, kidney failure, tumour growth, thrombosis, and severe viral infectious diseases. 
We know that mental stress can have a negative effect on blood vessel function.

A UK research team from the University of Birmingham examined the effects of cocoa 
flavanols on stress-induced changes on vascular function publishing their findings in Nutrients.

Lead author, Dr. Catarina Rendeiro, of the University of Birmingham's School of Sport, 
Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences, explains: "We found that drinking flavanol-rich cocoa 
can be an effective dietary strategy to reduce temporary impairments in endothelial function 
following mental stress and also improve blood flow during stressful episodes."

"Flavanols are extremely common in a wide range of fruit and vegetables. By utilizing 
the known cardiovascular benefits of these compounds during periods of acute vascular 
vulnerability (such as stress) we can offer improved guidance to people about how to 
make the most of their dietary choices during stressful periods."
