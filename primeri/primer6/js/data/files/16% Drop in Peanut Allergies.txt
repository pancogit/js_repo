16% Drop in Peanut Allergies Among Children As Parents Follow Guidelines And Introduce Peanuts Earlier

Changes to food allergy guidelines has led to a 16% decrease in peanut allergy among infants, according to new study.

The research, led by the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI), also found a significant increase 
in parents introducing peanut into their babies diet since the guideline changes.

Introducing peanut early in a child's life has been shown to prevent peanut allergy during randomized 
controlled trials. But MCRI PhD candidate and study lead author Victoria Soriano said this research was 
the first to test the approach in homes and to analyze what impact the guideline changes have had on peanut allergies.

International infant feeding guidelines changed in 2016 to recommend introduction of peanut and other 
allergenic foods before 12 months.

"In the 1990s some guidelines recommended avoiding allergenic foods until age 1-3 years and avoidance of 
these foods in infancy became widespread", Ms Soriano said.

"By 2008, this advice started to be removed based on increasing evidence that delaying allergenic foods was 
associated with an increased food allergy risk. However, evidence was still insufficient for specific 
recommendations for what age these foods should be introduced."

The Melbourne study compared data from the 1,933 infants enrolled in the EarlyNuts study in 2018-2019 
to the 5,276 infants recruited in the HealthNuts study across 2007-2011.

The research found the peanut allergy prevalence in 2018-2019 was 2.6 per cent compared to 3.1 per cent 
in 2007-2011, which amounted to a 16% decrease after accounting for migration and population changes.

In 2018-2019, infants who did not consume peanut until 12 months or later, 4.8% were allergic. Severe 
reactions to introducing peanut early were uncommon, the data showed.

Ms Soriano said despite initial concern that parents may not follow the advice to introduce peanut early 
there was a high uptake.
