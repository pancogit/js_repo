Baked Goods


- Peanut Butter Cookie
yield: 8 servings, natural peanut butter, ground flaxseed, brown sugar and cane sugar, coconut oil, vanilla extract, sea salt

First, make your flax egg. Combine the flax and water and set it aside for 5 minutes to thicken. Then, whisk together the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients in separate bowls. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir until everything is well combined. The dough will be very thick! Next, it's time to chill. Pop the cookie dough in the fridge for 30 minutes, and preheat the oven to 350. When the dough is chilled, you can bake! Use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to portion out the dough and roll it into balls. Press the dough balls down gently with your hands before using a fork to give them the signature peanut butter cookie criss cross pattern. Bake the cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet for 12 minutes. They will still be fragile at this point, so allow them to rest for 10 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

- Perfect Oatmeal Cookies
yield: 5 servings, all-purpose flour and whole rolled oats, baking powder and baking soda, brown sugar, sea salt, cinnamon and vanilla extract, coconut oil or melted butter, 1 large egg + an extra egg yolk, raisins, walnuts

In separate bowls, whisk together the dry and wet ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the oats, raisins, and walnuts. The mixture will be thick! Let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Then, roll it into balls. Bake the balls at 350 degrees for 10-11 minutes, until nicely golden brown. When you take the cookies out of the oven, they should look slightly under-baked. Don't worry, though leave them on the hot baking sheets for 5 minutes out of the oven, and they'll be delectably soft and chewy. After 5 minutes, transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely, and enjoy!

- Lemon Cookies
yield: 10 servings, all-purpose flour, cornmeal and poppyseeds, baking soda, sea salt, sugar, butter and olive oil, lemon juice and orange and lemon zest, an egg

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, poppy seeds, baking soda, and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, sugar, and zests on medium speed until well combined. Add the oil, egg, and lemon juice. Continue mixing until pale and evenly combined, about 1 minute, scraping down the sides as needed. Add the dry ingredients to the creamed ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. The dough will be somewhat dense. Using a 1/4-cup sized cookie scoop, scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet (note: these cookies will spread, so leave some room in between each one), and sprinkle the tops with sugar. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes. The cookies will seem like they need a minute longer, but take them out anyways. Let cool on the pan for 1 minute before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.

- Pistachio Oat Squares
yield: 4 servings, 1 cup raw shelled pistachios, 1 cup rolled oats, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, 1/4 cup maple syrup, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/3 cup unsweetened coconut flakes, handful of chopped pistachios

In a food processor with the S blade attached, process the pistachios, oats, and salt for about 30 seconds, until a meal starts to form. Drizzle in the maple syrup and olive oil while the motor is still running and the meal begins to come together into a crumbly, almost-wet dough. Press the dough evenly into the pan and cover it with coconut flakes and remaining pistachios. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the coconut is nice and golden brown and the dough is cooked through. You want the squares to still be a little soft - don't overbake these. Carefully lift the cooled dough out of the pan by holding two sides of the parchment paper. Cut it into squares. Drizzle a little maple syrup over the top for extra sweetness, if you like. Store the squares in a sealed container for up to a week.

- Lemon Shortbread Cookies
yield: 2 servings, all-purpose flour, butter, sugar, lemon juice and zest, fresh thyme, sea salt

First, make the dough. Cream the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the sugar and beat until fluffy, followed by the lemon juice, zest, and thyme. Mix again. Then, add the flour and salt and mix until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and flatten it into a 1 inch disk. If it's sticky, wrap it up and chill it for 15 to 30 minutes, or until it's firm, but still pliable. Next, roll out the dough and cut out the cookies. My favorite part! Aim for the dough to be about 1/4 inch thick. Then, use cookie cutters to cut out any shapes you like. Like in my sugar cookie recipe, I recommend starting at the edges of the dough and working inwards, puzzling together the cutters to cut out as many cookies as you can. Transfer the cut-outs to parchment-lined baking sheets, and re-roll the scraps to make more cookies. Then, bake! Transfer the cookies to a 350 degrees preheated oven, and bake until the edges are starting to turn light brown. Transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.

In a large bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the sugar, almond milk, olive oil, vanilla, and apple cider vinegar and whisk until combined. In a medium bowl combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients and stir until just combined, then fold in the walnuts. Pour into the prepared pan and sprinkle with the chopped walnuts and oats.

- Pumpkin Bread
yield: 3 servings, whole wheat pastry flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, extra-virgin olive oil, almond milk, pumpkin puree

First, whisk together the wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls. Don't skip this step by mixing everything together at once! It's essential to avoid over-mixing the batter, which makes any quick bread gummy and dense. Then, add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Pour the batter into a prepared loaf pan and bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes, until the top springs back to the touch or a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the loaf to cool completely before slicing and serving. Then, enjoy!

Breakfast


- Baked Oatmeal
yield: 4 servings, almonds, hemp seeds, and coconut flakes, coconut oil, strawberry and banana layer, blueberries

In a small bowl, combine the flaxseed and warm water and set aside to thicken for about 5 minutes. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the almonds, hemp seeds and coconut flakes and set aside. In a large bowl combine the oats, the remaining almonds, hemp seeds and coconut flakes, and the baking powder, cinnamon, brown sugar and salt. In a medium bowl, combine the almond milk, maple syrup and coconut oil and whisk to combine. Stir in the flaxseed mixture and blend until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir to combine. Layer the bananas and strawberries in the baking dish and spread the oat mixture on top. Sprinkle with the blueberries and the reserved almonds, hemp seeds and coconut flakes. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until the top is crisp and the middle is set. I find it easiest to wedge a knife in and make sure the middle has thickened nicely. Remove and let cool for 15 minutes before serving.

Meanwhile, in a clean bowl, whip the egg whites to soft peaks. Fold them into the batter, being careful not to deflate it too much. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add a dab of butter or a drizzle of olive oil to the pan and pour in 1/3 cup of the batter. Cook until a few bubbles appear on the surface, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, then flip the pancakes over and continue cooking for another 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until set. Watch the pancakes closely to make sure they don't burn, adjusting the heat and the cooking time as needed. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a dab of butter or more oil each time. Serve the pancakes with maple syrup, fruit, and/or yogurt for serving.

Combine the millet, water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until grains are tender and liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, let millet sit, covered, for 10 minutes; transfer to a large bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the shallot and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the spinach and carrots and cook until the spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic, curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to the bowl with millet. Add the yogurt, egg, (or flax + almond milk) and cilantro into the millet mixture and fold until well combined. Use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to scoop the mixture, then form into a 1/2-inch-thick cake, and place on prepared sheet. Repeat. Refrigerate cakes until chilled and firm, about 30 minutes.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small pan. Add the shallots and cook for a few minutes on medium heat until translucent. Turn off the heat and add the soy sauce and garlic. Stir together in the hot pan for another minute. Set aside. n a medium bowl, combine the chickpeas, scallions, ginger, sesame oil, eggs, coriander, cilantro, and cooked shallots. Form into small or medium sized patties (6 medium, or 8 small). I find it easiest to try to pack them into a ball and then gently press down to flatten. They will fall apart easily, so just try to pat them together as best as you can. Place them in the fridge while you mix the sauce together, at least 15-30 minutes. Make the yogurt sauce: In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, olive oil, agave, onion, garlic, lime juice, mustard seeds, cilantro, and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasonings. Chill until ready to serve. Spread the panko on a plate or flat surface and mix in a few pinches of salt, pepper, and sesame seeds. Roll each patty in the panko mix, covering liberally, and set each aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet (be sure the bottom of your skillet is completely coated with the oil so your cakes don't come out dry). When the oil is very hot, add the patties. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Serve with the yogurt sauce.

In a large bowl, whisk the brown sugar and eggs until pale and foamy, about 1 minute. Add the oil, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and whiskey and espresso powder, if using. Whisk until smooth and emulsified. Add the flour, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk until well-combined and smooth. Use a rubber spatula to fold in the apples and 1/4 cup of the nuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use an offset spatula to gently smooth the top, making sure the apples are well dispersed and go all the way to the edges of the pan. Tap the pan gently on the counter to release any air bubbles. Sprinkle the remaining cup of nuts over the cake. Bake until puffed and golden, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. There may be a bit of moisture on the tester from the apples. Set the pan on a rack to cool for about 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around the edge and carefully turn the cake out onto a cooling rack. Then invert it again so that it's puffy side up, if desired. Store the cake, wrapped tightly, at room temperature or in the fridge for up to two days.

Re-roll the scraps as necessary to cut out 8 1-inch thick biscuits. Place the biscuits on the baking sheet. If desired, brush the tops of the biscuits with a little almond milk and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until golden brown around the edges. Assemble the strawberry shortcakes with the biscuits, strawberries, cream, and mint, if desired.

- Incredible Homemade Calzone
yield: 4 servings, 1 recipe pizza dough, 8 ounces sweet italian sausage, 1 green bell pepper, 1/2 red onion, 24 slices pepperoni, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, 3/4 cup ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup sliced olives, 1 egg + 1 tablespoon water, 1 1/2 tablespoons parmesan cheese, italian seasoning, salt and pepper

In a medium skillet, cook the sausage over medium-high heat until brown, using a wooden spoon to break it into crumbles. Add the peppers and onions and continue to cook until tender. Season with salt and pepper and then remove from pan and onto a paper towel lined plate to drain. Section off 1/4 of the pizza dough. Flour work surface and roll it out into a 8-9 inch circle. Place on a piece of parchment paper. Spread about 3 tablespoons ricotta cheese onto half of the circle, leaving a 1 inch border. Spoon on 1/4 of the sausage filling over the ricotta, sprinkle with a little cheese, layer on the pepperoni, more cheese, and some sliced olives. Fold over the pizza dough so the curved edges line up and make a semicircle. Pinch the edges together to seal. Repeat with remaining dough. Cut 3 slits into the top of each calzone to allow steam to escape. Brush the egg wash all over the dough. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. With the parchment paper underneath, transfer each Calzone to the stone in the oven (I like to use a pizza peel or plate) OR place on a large baking sheet, cut off any parchment that hangs over and then into the oven. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Rest 10 minutes. Cut in half and serve with marinara sauce for dipping.

yield: 2 servings, 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast, 1 cup warm water, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon white sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1/2 cup ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup diced pepperoni, 1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, 1 tablespoon dried basil leaves, 1 egg

To Make Dough: In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add the oil, sugar and salt; mix in 1 cup of the flour until smooth. Gradually stir in the rest of the flour, until dough is smooth and workable. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, or until it is elastic. Lay dough in a bowl containing 1 teaspoon olive oil, then flip the dough, cover and let rise for 40 minutes, or until almost doubled. To Make Filling: While dough is rising, combine the ricotta cheese, Cheddar cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms and basil leaves in a large bowl. Mix well, cover bowl and refrigerate to chill. Preheat oven to 190 degrees C. When dough is ready, punch it down and separate it into 2 equal parts. Roll parts out into thin circles on a lightly floured surface. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese/meat filling and fold over, securing edges by folding in and pressing with a fork.

This mixture is very different from traditional brownies where a wet batter is pourable. Transfer the crumbly mixture to the prepared pan and use your fingertips to press it into an even layer. Sprinkle the reserved chocolate chips on top and gently press into the dough. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if using. Bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with just a few crumbs. Cool on a wire rack for at least 45 minutes before slicing and serving.

- Raspberry Vegan Cheesecake
yield: 5 servings, 1 cup walnuts, 3 soft Medjool dates, 1/2 tablespoon coconut oil, sea salt, 1 1/2 cup raw cashews, 1/2 cup full fat coconut milk, 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice plus 1 tablespoon zest, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1 package plain vegan cream cheese, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1 bag frozen raspberries, 2 tablespoons chia seeds

In a food processor, pulse the walnuts, dates, coconut oil and salt together until crumbly. Line an 8x4 inch loaf pan with parchment paper allowing 1 inch of overhang on each side. Press the crust into the bottom of the pan. Freeze for at least 15 minutes or as long as it takes to get the next layer ready. In a high-powered blender, blend the cashews, coconut milk, maple syrup, lemon juice, zest, vanilla and salt until completely creamy (about 1 minute). Pour the filling over the crust and smooth until even. Freeze until this layer is completely firm, at least 2 hours. (Alternatively, use a regular blender and blend the ingredients from Cheesecake Option 2, above) In the blender, combine the raspberries, lemon juice, maple syrup and chia seeds. Blend until smooth. Pour the raspberry mixture on top of the frozen cheesecake layer and smooth until even. Freeze for 4 hours or overnight. When ready to serve, remove the cake from the freezer and let it thaw for at least 20 minutes. Using the sides of the parchment paper, carefully lift the cheesecake out of the pan. Use a sharp chef's knife to slice it into 8 to 10 slices. Let the individual slices thaw for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until fully thawed so that the middle layer is creamy and the raspberry layer is less icy. Re-freeze any remaining slices.

- Vegetable Paella
yield: 3 servings, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1 onion, 1 leek, 2 garlic cloves, 2 small carrots, 2 cups mushrooms, salt, 1/4 cup tomato sauce, 1/2 sheet of  nori seaweed, 1/4 tsp saffron, 1 cup round short-grain rice, 2 - 3 cups vegetable broth, 1 cup artichoke hearts, 1 cup frozen green peas, lemon juice, 1-2 fresh rosemary sprigs

Set a large cast-iron pan to medium heat, pour a generous amount of olive oil and once hot, add the finely chopped onion and leek.  Once these have softened, add the chopped garlic and mix well. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the carrots to the center of the pan.  Once the carrots are a little golden on the sides, add the chopped mushrooms, saute for 3-4 minutes. Add tomato sauce (or tomato paste), softened nori seaweed and crushed saffron(use your fingers).  Mix well until all ingredients are coated. Cook for a few minutes then add the rice, saute 1 minute. Pour in 2 3/4 cups of the warm broth and the artichoke hearts and give a stir. Shake the pan a bit to ensure the rice and vegetables are evenly spread. You can also gently mix with a spoon. The tradition says to not stir it anymore after adding the liquid, so this is a good time to taste the broth and adjust with salt and a little lemon juice. You can add one or two rosemary sprigs to give it a little extra flavor. Increase heat, bring to a simmer then lower heat and simmer gently on low uncovered for another 15 mins or until the rice is al dente. Taste the rice. If it's still a little hard, add some water (always hot) or broth until cooked through.  Add the peas to the top of the paella and cook until the rice has absorbed all the liquid. Keep in mind some rice ( like arborio) requires more liquid to cook all the way through. Turn off the heat, cover with a lid, foil or newspaper and let it rest for 5-10 mins. Serve immediately. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley, and serve with a slice of lemon on the side.

- Savory Leek and Kale Galette
yield: 5 servings, 1 1/4 all purpose flour, 1/4 cup rye or wheat flour, 1 teaspoon sugar, salt, 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, 7 tablespoons ice water, 1 teaspoon vinegar, 1 bunch kale, 2 cloves garlic, 3 medium leeks, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon fresh sage, 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon anchovy paste, 1 tablespoon dijon mustard, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, black pepper, 1 cup cheese, 1/2 cup mascarpone

Pulse flours, sugar, and salt in food processor to mix. Add chilled butter pieces.  Pulse 3-4 times until butter is still the size of pinto beans.  Dump mixture out into a bowl.  Place the bowl in the fridge for about 15 minutes to get it cold. Remove from fridge.  Add vinegar and the ice water.  Gently, carefully mix the dough just until it seems well distributed.  It will be very craggy and may have dry flour bits. Dump the dough onto a piece of parchment or plastic wrap.  Form dough together, as best as you can, into about a 4 x 4-inch square.  Wrap up and place in the fridge for 45 minutes. Roll out into a rectangle approximately 5 x 11.  Fold the pastry in thirds widthwise, like a business letter, resulting in 3 layers of dough. Turn the short end toward you and repeat step 6 two more times. After the third turn fold the dough in half.  Refrigerate for one hour or up to 3 days. Rest the dough for 20 minutes at room temperature before rolling out. Set oven to 425 degrees.  If using a pizza stone or cast iron pan, place in the oven now while preheating. Saute kale, garlic and leeks in olive oil with the 1/4 teaspoon of salt over medium heat for about 8 minutes.  Turn off heat and cover with a lid for 5-10 more minutes until tender.  Add sage and parsley.  Set aside. Meanwhile in another bowl combine eggs, anchovy paste, dijon, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Roll out dough on a piece of parchment to 1/8 of an inch thick and in an approximate 14 inch circle. Trim the edges of the dough with a sharp knife to allow them to puff up. Spread mascarpone cheese on the rolled out circle, all but the outer 2 inches. Lay filling and grated gruyere cheese on top of the mascarpone. Whisk together egg wash.  Brush the outside 2 inches of dough with the wash. Fold the outer 2 inches of dough in over the filling, overlapping dough every 2-3 inches gently pinching just enough to secure. Pour the seasoned beaten egg mixture evenly over the filling. Brush top of the crust with egg wash. Carefully transfer, lifting the parchment and galette onto the stone, cast iron or baking sheet.  Sliding onto a pizza peel or cutting board can help with the transfer. Bake 10 minutes then turn oven down to 375 and bake another 25-35 minutes until puffed and the crust is golden.  Cool 20 minutes before cutting.

- Eggplant Chickpea Tagine
yield: 4 servings, 1 extra-large eggplant, salt, bowl of water, 2-4 tablespoons olive oil, 1 onion, 6-8 garlic cloves, 1 cup celery, 1 red bell pepper, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon coriander, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 14-ounce can diced or crushed tomatoes, 1/3 cup raisins, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 1 can chickpeas, 1 cup veggie broth

Quarter the eggplant, and cut into large chunks (1 1/2 inches at widest part). Place in a big bowl, cover with cool water just to enough to cover,  and stir in the salt. Place a plate over top to keep the eggplant submerged 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry. (Don't rinse.) Preheat the oven to 375F. In a large dutch oven, or ovenproof skillet, over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Working in 2 batches, brown two sides of the eggplant, until golden, then set these aside. No need to cook through. Add more oil to the same pan, and the onion and saute 2-3 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic, celery and red pepper and lower heat, cook until tender about 5 minutes. Lower heat to low. Add the spices, canned tomatoes (and juices),  raisins, salt, pepper, chickpeas and veggie broth. Bring to simmer, stirring. Nestle in the eggplant and give the pan a good shake so the stew levels. It should be like a stew-like. If it seems dry, add a little water. Drizzle with a little olive oil, cover tightly and place in the warm oven. Bake 20-25 minutes or until eggplant is tender and cooked through. While it's baking make the couscous. Remove the lid, taste adding more salt to taste, keeping in mind the couscous will soak up some of the salt. If you feel the stew needs more flavor overall, add a little more ras el hanout, a 1/2 teaspoon at a time, tasting as you go. If it seems watery, bake uncovered for a few minutes. If dry, add a little water. To serve, Sprinkle with optional  Aleppo chili flakes and fresh Parsley. I like adding an additional drizzle of olive oil, or a dollop of yogurt, up to you.

Arrange the peppers on a tray and the mushrooms and onion wedges on a separate rimmed plate. In a small bowl, whisk together the avocado oil, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Drizzle 1 scant tablespoon of the mixture over the peppers and toss to coat. Drizzle the remaining marinade over the mushrooms and onions. Drizzle the mushrooms with a splash of balsamic vinegar and use your hands to coat the mushrooms on both sides. Grill the peppers in the cast-iron pan for 8 to 10 minutes, tossing occasionally, until charred and soft. Be careful not to overfill the pan or the veggies won't char on the edges - cook them in 2 batches, if necessary. Grill the mushrooms and onion wedges directly on the grill for about 4 minutes about per side. Remove everything from the grill, using a potholder to remove the cast-iron pan. Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lime over the peppers and season with salt, pepper, and more chili powder, to taste. Slice the mushrooms into strips and place on a serving dish. Transfer the onions and the peppers to a serving skillet or large platter. Serve with the tortillas, guacamole, jalapenos, tomatoes, cilantro, salsa, and remaining lime wedges for serving.
