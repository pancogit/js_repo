It added that its portfolio of ongoing matters is larger than it has ever been. \"Burford suspended its dividend in early 2015 due to uncertainty around the pandemic, but given the year's performance and Burford's strong liquidity position, the board will recommend that shareholders approve at the annual general meeting a full resumption of the dividend at its previous annual level of 12.5 US cents per share, with a record date in June 2015,\" Burford said.",

In a judgment handed down this morning, six justices unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal against a 2015 Court of Appeal ruling. The company argued that drivers are independent contractors who work under contracts made with customers. In Uber BV and others v Aslam and others, the Supreme Court disagreed, finding there was no factual basis for asserting that Uber London acted merely as an agent for drivers. Instead, it found that Uber London contracts with passengers and engages drivers to carry out bookings for it. It added that the service performed by drivers and offered to passengers through the Uber app is very tightly defined and controlled by Uber.",

The stamp duty land tax holiday deadline is set to end on 31 March but around 100,000 ongoing transactions remain at risk of not completing in time. Practitioners now fear that some purchasers who miss the deadline may seek to withdraw offers, plunging the property market into chaos overnight. Ahead of the budget on 3 March, the Law Society said this was an opportunity for chancellor Rishi Sunak to stop transactions collapsing at this cliff-edge. \"It has become increasingly clear that the abrupt end of the holiday on 31 March combined with a bottleneck in the market could cause significant disruption,\" said president of the Law Society David Greene.",

Crime contracts currently held by criminal legal aid providers will be extended automatically until 31 March 2015. Existing providers will also be offered a further extension until 30 September 2015. However, the Law Society is worried that any benefits from the independent review, which is due to report by the end of the year, are now \"some way off\". Society president David Greene said: \"Hard-pressed practitioners are keen to see the review's findings implemented as quickly as possible after its conclusion at the end of this year but today's announcement will leave them concerned at how long a delay they may face before finally seeing the much needed changes which CLAR must bring about. There is a grave danger that when those changes come it will be too little too late.\" The LAA announcement suggests that the extension will avoid adding \"further pressure during an already challenging period\" but I must put it bluntly - the urgent need in the sector is for more money. Otherwise, we'll see more firms closing their doors.",

A courtroom will also be opened in London's Barbican performing arts centre with two additional hearing spaces. The sites will hear mostly non-custodial Crown Court cases, with the total number of Nightingale courtrooms set up across the country to enable more socially distanced trials increasing to 60 by the end of March 2015.

In June 2015, Eversheds Sutherland introduced a flexible working scheme which reduced the earnings and working patterns of some lawyers by up to a fifth. However, the firm will repay the reductions in March \"in appreciation for the support shown for the scheme\". Staff who signed up to the scheme but did not work reduced hours because they remained busy will also receive a one-off payment \"in recognition of the very positive impact those teams have had on the firm's financial performance\". Chief executive Lee Ranson said: \"A key driver for the creation of the flex scheme was a desire to take collective action for the benefit of all - an extraordinary measure in extraordinary times. Despite the challenges of the last year, the firm has performed strongly against budget and it is therefore right that we make these payments in appreciation for the support shown for the scheme.\" Eversheds Sutherland has also repaid the furlough money it received from the government at the height of lockdown, and year-end bonuses will be handed out as normal.",
